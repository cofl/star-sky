<p>The Ngema hail from the world <a href="/star-sky/setting/locations/aster/ngema/">Ngema</a>, and are one of the three founding races of the <a href="/star-sky/setting/factions/commonwealth/">Commonwealth</a>. Much like the <a href="../humans/">humans</a>, their counterparts from <a href="/star-sky/setting/locations/aster/ter/">Ter</a>, the Ngema are a restless people, who rapidly spread out across the towering mountains, golden plains, uncharted forests, frigid tundras, and scorching deserts of their homeworld. Determined to prove their worth to the gods, they set out across the stormy seas, and now set out across the sea of stars, eager and willing to make their mark on history.</p>

<p>&quot;Kazha tightened her grip on the pen as she pored over the map. Three more weeks until they reached where the Abyss was supposed to be. The young Schnezno glanced over her shoulder at her odd traveling companion, who by this hour was fast asleep, mouth agape, light from the lantern dancing its cage’s shadows across their pale features.</p>
<p>&quot;She sighed, then rose, padding over and drawing the blanket to better cover Pellu. “I swear,” she exclaimed in hushed voice, “if the prince isn’t to be the death of me, then surely you will.” A thin but warm smile couldn’t help but appear on Kazha’s face. “Jeez —a thousand miles from where we started and yet you’ve still got that look on your face. Don’t worry. We’ll find a way home for you yet.”</p>
<p>“Pellu turned over in their sleep, holding the blanket tight. Their worries would wait 'til the morrow.”

<p>The Ngema are a cat-like race. Despite the numerous varieties, though, from all across <a href="/star-sky/setting/locations/aster/ngema/">the world</a>, most Ngema are about the same — that is to say, there is no typical Ngema, but there are groups that look similar. An individual can stand from 3 and a half feet to around 5 feet tall, and usually weighs from 60 to 130 pounds. Ngema coats vary in pattern and coloration depending on race, but the flesh underneath is always a pale pink. Males tend to be taller than females, rarely standing below 4 feet. Ngema reach adulthood in their early teens and typically live for around 75 years, a drastic improvement from their pre-industrial 40-year lifespan.</p>
<h2 id="variety-in-all-things">Variety in All Things <a class="fa fa-link link-icon" href="#variety-in-all-things" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2>
<p>Ngema are an adaptable and ambitious people. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have laid down roots. At the heart of culture and progress on Ngema are the great cities, built to last the ages, and the borders of style are still drawn from the remanants of kingdoms that lasted for centuries before <a href="#TODO">the unification of Ngema under a single flag</a>. An individual ngema might have a short life, but a nation or culture is what binds them together, preserving what makes each people far beyond the reach of any single ngema’s memory. They live in the present, with an eye for the future, but always have a foot in the past, and are unwilling to forget their heritage.</p>

<p>Where the <a href="../humans/">humans</a> rule the <a href="/star-sky/setting/factions/commonwealth/">Commonwealth</a> with a vision in mind, it is often the ngema that implement that vision. They are the second most numerous of the five races, and anywhere you’d find a human, you’ll usually find a ngema to match somewhere nearby, especially in the <a href="#TODO">inner colonies</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Humans.</strong></dt>
<dd>“They’re a lot like us, yeah? Sure a little taller, and they look really cold, but we’re a lot alike. If I had to pick between a human and someone else… ngema need to stick together, sorry.”</dd>
<dt><strong>Elves.</strong></dt>
<dd>“They’re so pretty! So sad all the time, though, a lot of them. Humans need to treat them better. Now if only I could tell them apart without looking too hard…”</dd>
<dt><strong>Sarkany.</strong></dt>
<dd>“Sarkany look like everything that make humans not like us taken to an extreme. Their scales are shiny, but it’s a dull glitter. They seem so distant and aloof, but at least they know how to respect where they came from.”</dd>
<dt><strong>Europans.</strong></dt>
<dd>“Wha! They’re so squishy! It’s hard to believe they actually built everything they did down there under the Europan ice sheets, but it’s kinda cool, right? If there’s a Europan engineer on my side, I’m sure even if something breaks, we’ll be back up and running in no time.”</dd>

<p>It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your ngeman character has these traits.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></dt>
<dd>Your dexterity score increases by 2, and your strength score decreases by 1.</dd>
<dt><strong>Age.</strong></dt>
<dd>Ngema reach adulthood in their early teens and live around 75 years.</dd>
<dt><strong>Alignment.</strong></dt>

<dt><strong>Size.</strong></dt>
<dd>Ngema vary in height and build, from barely 3 and a half feet to around 5 feet tall, with male ngema almost never below 4 feet. Below 4 and a half feet, your size is Small, and otherwise Medium.</dd>
<dt><strong>Speed.</strong></dt>
<dd>Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</dd>
<dt><strong>Perceptive.</strong></dt>

<dt><strong>Cat-Eyed.</strong></dt>
<dd>You can see in dim light within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness within 10 feet of you as if it were dim light.</dd>
