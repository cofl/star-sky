<p>Humans are the traditional masters of much of Ter, and one of the three founding races of the <a href="/setting/factions/commonwealth/">Commonwealth</a>. They are a restless people, who long ago crossed the great plains, charted the forests and vales, and took to the seas in great ships of discovery and war. An energy, a love of adventure, sang from every page of their history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Long into the night Liriel read, lamp glowing dim. She’d never given much thought to humans, but these stories fascinated her. In these dusty pages were tales of bold heroes, strange and fierce animals, mighty primitive gods and a hunger for progress that was part and fabric of that distand land.”

<p>With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than most other races of the <a href="/setting/factions/commonwealth/">Commonwealth</a>. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight), but never blues or greens; males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and typically live for around a century.</p>

<p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people on Ter. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a short life, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.</p>

<p>There’s a certain respect one has to give the humans: they’re living proof that if you throw if enough shit at the wall, some of it will stick. The greatest leaders of Ter and of the Commonwealth have all been human; it’s mostly <em>human</em> colonists settling across the far-flung worlds around other stars (the the <a href="./#ngema">Ngema</a> will give them a run for their money yet).</p>

<dt><strong>Elves.</strong></dt>
<dd>“Bah, what good are they? They’re not better than us, no matter how much they think they are, gene-forging or no. Most of them seem fine, I guess, if they keep themselves, but there’s always the ones that want to prove themselves…”</dd>
<dt><strong>Sarkany.</strong></dt>
<dd>“If it weren’t for the Sarkany, it’d have been maybe another two or three whole generations before we could make it to the stars. I haven’t seen too many away from Ter, but they’ve always got the important jobs wherever they end up, and they deserve it, too.”</dd>
<dt><strong>Ngema.</strong></dt>
<dd>“They remind me of my cat. So small! But same as my cat, don’t make one cross or you might not live to be forgiven. Ngema are probably the best mages I’ve ever seen. Magic is such a part of them I’m surprised all the buildings in their cities don’t fly.”</dd>
<dt><strong>Europans.</strong></dt>
<dd>“Europans, eh? They’re hard to read. Not like the rest of us at all. If I were to come across one, I probably wouldn’t trust them, but one on my crew? I’d sooner have them than my own brother. Reliable, tough, and a real knack for keeping everything in one piece that’s supposed to be.”</dd>
