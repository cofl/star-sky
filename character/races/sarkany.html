<blockquote>
<p>Her father stood at the end of the stone walk leading up to the house, unmoving. The scales of his face had grown paler around the edges, but Jószua of No-House still looked as if he could wrestle down a dire bear himself. His familiar well-worn armor was gone, replaced by blackened plate with bright silvery tracings. There was a blazon on his arm as well, the mark of some foreign house. The sword at his back was the same, though, the one he had carried since even before…</p>
<p>For all her life, Adél had known that reading her father’s face was a skill she’d been fortunate to learn. A human who couldn’t spot the shift of her eyes or Donát’s would certainly see only the indifference of a drake in Jószua No-House’s face. But the shift of scales, the arch of a ridge, the set of his eyes, the gape of his teeth—her father’s face spoke volumes.</p>
<p>But ever scale of it, this time, seemed completely still—the indifference of a drake, even to Adél.</p>

<p>The Sarkany are the second and oldest race native to <a href="#TODO">Ter</a>, and one of the three founding races of the <a href="#TODO">Commonwealth</a>. The lands <a href="./#human">humans</a> dare not tread, you will find them: from the deepest caverns to the dells and foothills of the great mountains. The stone is their birthright, and from it they wrought the greatest works of engineering <a href="#TODO">Ter</a> would ever see. Even after the <a href="#TODO">discovery of life on Europa</a>, the Sarkany remained the most reknowned craftsmen of the modern age.</p>
<p>Despite on many occasions crossing swords with humans, the age-old foes have laid aside their weapons and begun the building of the <a href="#TODO">greatest empire</a> known to the <a href="#TODO">Veil</a>. Without the aid of Sarkany academics, it could have taken two or three generations more for humans to reach the stars on their own. Sarkany universities, such as the <a href="#TODO">University of Hévíz</a>, are the greatest centers of learning in the <a href="#TODO">Commonwealth</a>, teaching millions of students every year from all the vast reaches of the colonies and the core worlds alike, and pushing the bounds of what is possible ever forward.</p>
<p>Sarkany can live to be more than 300 years old, so the oldest living sarkany often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest sarkany alive <a href="#TODO">today</a> can recall the day the first faster-than-light ship made <a href="#TODO">the first trip</a> to the system of <a href="#TODO">Proxima Panthi</a>, over two hundred years ago.</p>
<hr>
<p>To any Sarkany, the good of the household is more important than life itself. Sarkany owe their devotion and respect to their household above all else, even the gods. Each sarkanis’ conduct reflects on the honor of their house, and bringing dishonor to the house can result in expulsion and exile.</p>
<p>A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the tenacity of the race as a whole. Sarkany value skill and excellence in all endeavors, but are patient enough to step back when something doesn’t seem right and work out the problems before moving on, even if the problems don’t want to give them the time. Failure is just another tool for success.</p>
<p>Sarkany religion is based around the worship of the ancestors, though it’s not unheard of for individual households to take a <a href="#TODO">human god</a> into their pantheon.</p>
<h3 id="names">Names <a class="fa fa-link link-icon" href="#names" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3>
<p>Sarkany have personal names given at birth, and inherit the family and household names from their parents. A childhood name or nickname is often used among siblings as a descriptive term or a term of endearment. The name might recall an event or center on a habit.</p>

<p>The Sarkany are oft described as lizard-like, with snouts like a drake, and all over adorned with metallic scales that shimmer in the pale glow of the lava flows and the bright glare of the mid-day sun. Each subrace of Sarkany can be identified by the color of their scales. Height varies between the varieties, some averaging a few inches shorter than the average human, and others towering head-and-a-half higher. Regardless of height, you are a Medium creature.</p>
<p>Your sarkany chacater has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of their nature.</p>

<dt><strong>Age.</strong></dt>
<dd>Sarkany mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered children until they reach the age of 30. On average, they live for 280 years.</dd>
<dt><strong>Alignment.</strong></dt>
<dd>Most Sarkany are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. Whether they are good or evil depends on the house: for example, house Kovách of Hévíz is traditionally good, assisting the minor houses and promoting the arts and sciences, and the pursuit of fair play; house Szabó, on the other hand, often falls to less scrupulous tactics to gain the upper hand in both the city politics and their research— though it should be noted that both sides pursue the greater good.</dd>

<h3 id="dalish">Dalish <a class="fa fa-link link-icon" href="#dalish" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3>
<p>The Dalish Sarkany are the most common on the surface of and beyond Ter; long ago, their founding households left the great caves for the surface, where they now populate the foothills, forests, and dells of the Titan mountain range. Dalish Sarkany are also the shortest of the Sarkany breeds, standing between five and six and a half feet tall. Their scales vary in color from a coppery brass to a patina sheen.</p>
<p>Dalish Sarkany are known for their skill as sorcerers and diplomats.</p>

<p>Moving further into the mountains, Vasak Sarkany are most common here. They tend to be taller than their Dalish cousins, between under six and under seven feet, and their scales take a dull grey to iron tone. Vasak mercenaries were highly sought after for their strength, durability, and aptitude with the divine, which was not hampered by their armor.</p>

<h3 id="kovek">Kovek <a class="fa fa-link link-icon" href="#kovek" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3>
<p>Kovek Sarkany claim to be the eldermost of the Sarkany breeds, and stake their claim deep within the caverns under the Titan’s Shield, the entrances of which are protected by the frigid Sanghar Desert to the north, and the towering Titan Mountains to the south. Kovek Sarkany tower over their brethren, standing between six and eight feet tall. Their scales are red, gold, or bronze.</p>
<p>It is Kovek crafts and academia that are the main draws to seek them out. Many an engineer, aspiring mage, or artificer has sought them out over the centuries, or today attends the grand university they established in their capital city, <a href="#TODO">Hévíz</a>.</p>

<p>Lohin Sarkany are by far the rarest of the four breeds. Their silvery-white scales blend in well with the ice and snow of the far reaches of the Sanghar Desert and the Käärmeissä Peninsula. They are a hardy people, and many have moved on to other worlds, leaving just a few behind on Ter.</p>
<p>Their height ranges from between five and a half and six and a half feet.</p>
