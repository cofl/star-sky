<h2 id="sarkany"><a href="./sarkany.html">Sarkany</a> <a class="fa fa-link link-icon" href="#sarkany" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2>
<p>The Sarkany are the people native to the mountains and the deep places of Ter, beautiful folk known for their iridescent scales that glitter in the pale glow of the lava flows. Though theyâ€™ve crossed spears, swords, and cannonfire with the other races of Ter many a time, after the spread of globalization and the industrial revolution they have become one of the dominant races of the <a href="/setting/factions/commonwealth/">Commonwealth</a>.</p>
<h2 id="elf"><a href="./elves.html">Elf</a> <a class="fa fa-link link-icon" href="#elf" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2>
<p>The Elves are the youngest of the five races, but the fourth to join the ranks of the <a href="/setting/factions/commonwealth/">Commonwealth</a>. A result of three hundred years of genetic modification and magical tampering, this human subrace emerged as a species in its own right shortly after <a href="/setting/timeline/first-contact.md">first contant</a> with <a href="/setting/locations/ngema/">Ngema</a> in <a href="/setting/timeline/#2103">2103</a>. Oft looked down upon by the traditional masters of Ter, the <a href="#human">Humans</a> and <a href="#sarkany">Sarkany</a>, elves know they have to work hard to prove they deserve their place in the stars.</p>
<h2 id="europan">Europan <a class="fa fa-link link-icon" href="#europan" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2>
<p>Europans are the newest members of the <a href="/setting/factions/commonwealth/">Commonwealth</a>. Hailing from the frigid oceans under the lifeless ice sheets of the far-off moon of <a href="/setting/locations/jun/">Jun</a>, <a href="/setting/locations/jun/europa/">Europa</a>, this race of highly intelligent ooze-like creatures are reknowned for their engineering prowess and ability to fix seemingly anything that could be wrong with a space-going vessel. What they give in skill, though, they lack in charisma: the other races often find it hard to communicate with them, and they with the other races, especially the <a href="#ngema">Ngema</a>.</p>
<h2 id="human"><a href="./humans.html">Human</a> <a class="fa fa-link link-icon" href="#human" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2>
<p>Humans are the traditional masters of much of Ter, and one of the three founding races of the <a href="/setting/factions/commonwealth/">Commonwealth</a>. They are a restless people, who long ago crossed the great plains, charted the forests and vales, and took to the seas in great ships of discovery and war. An energy, a love of adventure, sang from every page of their history.</p>
