# Race Options
Due to the setting, the race options available in this campaign are slightly different. Do not use a race not listed below with talking to me about it first.

## Demon
The Demons are the people native to the mountains and the deep places of Ter, beautiful folk known for their iridescent scales that glitter in the pale glow of the lava flows. Though they've crossed spears, swords, and cannonfire with the other races of Ter many a time, after the spread of globalization they have become one of the dominant races of the [Commonwealth].

## Elf

## Europan

## Human
