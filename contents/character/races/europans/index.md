# Europans
<!--{#top.center}-->
<div class="subtitle">Dwellers of the Inky Black</div>

Europans are the newest members of the [Commonwealth]. Hailing from the frigid oceans under the lifeless ice sheets of the far-off moon of [Jun], [Europa], this race of highly intelligent ooze-like creatures are reknowned for their engineering prowess and ability to fix seemingly anything that could be wrong with a space-going vessel. What they give in skill, though, they lack in charisma: the other races often find it hard to communicate with them, and they with the other races, especially the [Ngema].

## Physical Features
Born under the crushing weight of a miles of water and ice, europans are utterly alien compared to the land-dwelling races of the [Commonwealth]: amorphous, ooze-like creatures of varying size and mass, some miniscule, and others gargantuan hulks towering over the other races. Whatever the dimensions, all are extraordinarily resilient and flexible. Where one would expact a slimy jelly like the feral oozes of Ter, europans instead have a firm surface similar in texture to a cat's tongue all over. This skin still stretches and bends with ease, though, allowing europans to grow and retract numerous psuedopodia, though the number of them that may be used for intense actions like fighting or casting is limited by a europan's size. Not all races of europans share this flexibility, though: some have the right structure to give themselves a humanoid form, whereas others can just barely turn a wrench or pull a trigger.

## Traits and Kinds
Your europan character is defined by their ability: to move, to hit, to shape, and to think. Whatever line of europans they descend from decides these. The varieties of europans are named after their color by outsiders; and as it turns out, it's close enough to the terms the europans use amongst themselves.

**Age.**
: Europans reach maturity rapidly, after just five years, but are not considered adults until their fifteenth year. They live on average ninety years.

**Alignment.**
: Most europans are Lawful Neutral or Neutral; rarely are they chaotic unless insanity takes its hold.

**Size.**
: Exact size varies between varieties, but most europans "stand" around five feet tall and weigh between 140 and 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.**
: Your base walking speed is 30, and you have a swimming speed of 30.

**Superior Darkvision.**
: Evolved in the dark oceans of Europa, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light or in darkness within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light.

**Light Sensitivity.**
: You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight or an equivalent light source.

**Alien Anatomy.**
: Due to your unique physiology, you are unable to speak non-europan languages, but you can understand, read, and write them.

**Amphibious.**
: You can breathe air and water.

**Amorphous.**
: You can assume various simple shapes and extend pseudopodia to hold on to small objects. Except for pseudopodia, changing your form requires a DC 15 Constitution check, and another DC 15 Constitution check every minute to maintain the form. If you fail this check, your form collapses back to its original shape. Regardless of what form you take, you cannot use more than two pseudopodia as a humanoid would hands.

### Black
Black europans are the most grounded of the varieties; where the purple they see as scheming, the white as brutish, and the rust as simple, black europans can be counted on to see things for the way there are and tell you.

**Ability Score Increase.**
: Your Wisdom and Constitution scores increase by 1.

**Wise.**
: You have advantage on Wisdom saves and Wisdom-based skill checks a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier between long rests, and can always take 10 on Wisdom-based skill checks.

### Brown and Rust
Brown and Rust-colored europans are the most common varieties. Rust-colored europans tend to be slightly smaller than their brown cousins, but the two are otherwise almost identical.

**Ability Score Increase.**
: Your Dexterity and Constitution scores increase by 1.

### Green
Green europans are reknowned for their ability to wriggle out of almost any situation.

**Ability Score Increase.**
: Your Dexterity score increases by 3.

**Rather Amorphous.**
: You can assume various simple shapes and extend pseudopodia to hold on to small objects. Except for pseudopodia, changing your form to anything other than a blob or tube requires a DC 18 Constitution check, and you can only hold the form for 3 rounds. Regardless of what form you take, you cannot use more than two pseudopodia as a humanoid would hands. This ability replaces the normal Amorphous ability other europans have.

### Pink
Pink europans are the most charismatic of the europan varieties; they are diplomats, negotiators, and entertainers. Pink europans are also the only variety capable of maintaining complex forms for extended periods of time.

**Ability Score Increase.**
: Your Charisma and Constitution scores increase by 1.

**Shaped.**
: You can assume various simple or complex shapes, such as a humanoid form, and extend pseudopodia to hold on to small objects. Regardless of what form you take, you cannot use more than two pseudopodia as a humanoid would hands. This ability replaces the normal Amorphous ability other europans have.

### Purple
Purple europans are the thinkers and the planners; they have to be, given that their small stature works against them considerably.

**Ability Score Increase.**

**Intelligent.**
: You have advantage on Intelligence saves and Intelligence-based skill checks a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier between long rests, and can always take 10 on Intelligence-based skill checks.
