# Elves
<!--{#top.center}-->
<div class="subtitle">Sweat our pride, Blood our bane.</div>

The Elves are the youngest of the five races, but the third to join the ranks of the [Commonwealth]. A result of three hundred years of genetic modification and magical tampering, this human subrace emerged as a species in its own right shortly after [first contact] with [Ngema] in [2103]. Oft looked down upon by the traditional masters of Ter, the [Humans] and [Sarkany], elves know they have to work hard to prove they deserve their place in the stars.

## Physical Features
Elves, though similar to humans in may regards, are distinguished by their elongated features, with pointed ears and narrow noses. The average standsfrom just over five to nearly seven feet tall, taller on average than humans of the same age, but weighing a mere 100 to 150 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.

Being drawn from a common stock, nearly all elves have the same homogenous caramel skin tone. The most common hair colors are blacks and browns, though coppery reds, metallic blondes, and deep blue-greens are not unheard of.

## Culture and Names
Elves share much of their culture and history with humans, and so share many of their customs and names, such as Alex, Kris, Iseul, Robert, May, and the like, drawing upon their heritage as the product of all of humanity on Ter.

Holding the status of the youngest and weakest of the five races of the [Commonwealth], however, elves are often shunned by the traditionalists. The response is divided: many elves seek to show that they've earned their place amongst the stars, though a number more simply draw their hoods and live on; another faction has naught but contempt for the elder races -- the elves in the far-flung crime dens and pirate refuges, the domestic instigators and terrorists, and the angry labourer all fall in this camp.

> Iseul saw from the corner of her eye the lines of the changing shifts funneling down the road -- the driver clicked in her hand, drawing her attention back to the bolts lined up a hundred feet on the steel below her. "Two hundred," she said, letting the drill hang down as she wiped her brow.
> 
> She unclipped the catch and started to rappel back down. *They said I could only do a hundred and fifty.*

> "No elves allowed" read the sign by the door. Robert sighed and tightened his hat on his head, and just moved on. *Guess it's whatever's left on the ship again,* he thought to himself, failing to notice the oncoming group until they bumped into him.

> "Watch it, sharp-ear," the kid growled at him. Robert apologized as quickly as he could, and tried to get on his way.

> "His boots thundered, e'ry step he took, I swea', the Reaper 'imself! Karen, Jimmy, Cap'n, he lined 'em all up and spiked 'em right through, I's scared stiff I was, coul'n't even look, then he steps right up to me&mdash; steps right up t'me 'e does and 'e says, he asks me "Sharp-ear. You with them?"
> 
> "Now I jus', I jus' shake my head 'n' he sighs, like, 'm not sure if he's gon' run me through too, or wot, 'n he says then "Sharp-ear to sharp-ear, tell them this: there's always a place for the oppressed in the crew of the *Fire and Fury*. The out-modes last days on top are here."

### On the Outside
Despite having been human once, elves are held in lower standing than most other races. Still, they keep looking forward, and find friends in the unlikeliest of places.

**Humans.**
: "They're everywhere &mdash; there isn't a colony or ship in the Veil where you won't find a human. Being common doesn't mean they're mundane, though. They can do everything we can&mdash; even though we can do it better."

**Sarkany.**
: "Sarkany are brilliant, and you can always feel safe when one's got your back. They're terribly common outside the bigger colonies, but they stick with who they care about, and are just as tough as their scale hide suggests."

**Europans.**
: "To be honest, the Europans scare me a bit. You can never tell if it's looking at you like another person, or something less&mdash; if you can even tell it's looking at you. Stil, they put the Sarkany to shame with their engineering. Half the problems I didn't know I had, they had a fix for."

## Elf Traits
Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of hundreds of years of tweaking and hard work.

**Ability Score Increase.**
: You may increase any three ability scores by 1, or one ability score by 2 and another by one.

**Age.**
: Elves reach adulthood at about the same age as humans, though unlike their counterparts from the stories of old, they do not live longer than their human origins; in most cases, elves actually tend to pass on average six to seven years sooner than humans.

**Alignment.**
: Like most citizens of the [Commonwealth], the average elf is Neutral-Good, Neutral-Lawful. Amongst the outcast groups, a more fervent evil may be found, though.

**Size.**
: Adult elves range from over five to under seven feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.**
: Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Keen Senses.**
: You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

**Magical Ancestry.**
: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Quick Sleeper**
: Elves don't need much sleep. Where [humans] and [sarkany] need eight hours of rest each night, elves often get by on just three or four. They are harder to rouse from this sleep, though, and due to its depth, only have fleeting dreams shortly before waking.

#### Rolling for Height and Weight

| Variant | Base Height | Base Weight | Height Modifier | Weight Modifier |
|--------:|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| A       | 5'0"        | 90 lbs      | + 3d8           | &times; 1d4     |
| B       | 5'0"        | 85 lbs      | + 3d8 + 1d4     | &times; 1d4     |
| C       | 5'4"        | 90 lbs      | + 4d8dh1        | &times; 2d4dh1  |
- **Height** = `Base Height + Height Modifier (in inches)`
- **Weight** = `Base Weight + Height Modifier (in pounds) Ã— Weight Modifier`

### Variant A
The most common variety of elves are called "Variant A" by the scientific community; they are known for their skills and speed, both in the tasks they can accomplish, and in getting out of trouble.

**Fleet of Foot.**
: Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.

**Skilled.**
: You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

**Quick Talker.**
: You gain advantage to persuasion to stay out of or end combat.

### Variant B
"Variant B" elves are separated from "Variant A" by their ears, which tend to be an inch or two longer, and their prowess.

**Arcane Heritage.**
: You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

**Well-Trained.**
: You are proficient in one skill of your choice, and are fluent in an additional language for free.

### Variant B-2 &#40;C)
"Variant B-2" or "Variant C" elves share much with "Variant B", but are on average a bit shorter and a bit heavier.

**Arcane Ingenuity.**
: You know either the *chill touch*, *spare the dying*, or *thaumaturgy* cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

**Like a Shadow.**
: You move like lightning, disappearing and reappearing in an unoccupied space within 15 feet as a bonus action. After using this ability, you cannot use it again until you have taken a short or long rest.
