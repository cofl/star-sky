# Sorcerer
<!--{#top.center}-->

To a sorcerer, magic is like breath. The world is full of magic, and it is from the world that they draw their strength. A sorcerer's discipline is often decided by where they grew up, and when their power began to bud. Young sorcerers may find themselves sent away to enchanter's schools, where they learn the intricacies of magical theory; others may stumble across or seek out great and ancient beings with immense power, and in exchange for favors or other pacts, unlock the raw power lurking inside them, or borrow what their benefactor won't miss.
