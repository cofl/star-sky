    - Classes:
        - Sorcerer
            To a sorcerer, magic is like breath. The world is full of magic, and it is from the world that
            they draw their strength. A sorcerer's discipline is often decided by where they grew up, and
            when their power began to bud. Young sorcerers may find themselves sent away to enchanter's schools,
            where they learn the intricacies of magical theory; others may stumble across or seek out great
            and ancient beings with immense power, and in exchange for favors or other pacts, unlock the raw
            power lurking inside them, or borrow what their benefactor won't miss.

            Disciplines:
                - TODO
        - Enchanter
            Enchanting is the oldest of the sciences. Enchanters do not know the raw strength of a sorcerer, or
            the pure focus of a mystic, yet they excel at efficiency, ingenuity, and breadth. Young enchanters,
            those identified to have some talent for magic, begin their study early, building the magical strength
            necessary for enchanting over years of practice. The road is not easy, though, and many apprentices
            and students find themselves let go by their masters, or left behind by their peers, unable to cast more
            than a simple cantrip.

            Disciplines:
                - TODO
        - Mystic
            Mysticism is an ancient art, said to have been taught to man by the gods when the world was
            still young. Mystics harness the divine nature of the human spirit and the spirits otherworldly
            alike; magic is a living thing, born from within. Mystics tend to fall in two broad groups:
            the trained, and the self-taught. Trained mystics are priests, clerics, and monks, drawing on their
            chosen spirit's divine will to amplify their own inner strength and those of others, and tear down
            the weak souls of their enemies; self-taught mystics can be just as strong, though, and blend in
            to everday society just like you or I.
