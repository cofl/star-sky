# Star Sky
<!--{#top.center}-->

Star Sky is a D&D 5E Science Fantasy Campaign set in a fantasy world that has advanced technologically and become spacefaring. Spacefaring is limited to the local star cluster by the Veil, a dense dark nebula that makes it hazardous for ships to travel outside that range.
